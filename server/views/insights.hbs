					<h2>Insights</h2>
					<p>This page is description of the insights used to generate the information used in each section of the performance widget.</p>

					<h3 id='performance'>Performance</h3>
					<div>
						<p>These statistics come from <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Google PageSpeed Insights</a>. The information this service surfaces relate to the loading speed for page. </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Number of Connections to 3<sup>rd</sup> party sites, each connection requires a slow handshake which will slow down the site.</li>
							<li>The size of the content which needs to be downloaded, more content more needs to be downloaded. Consider reducing number of assets, minifying assets and optimising images.</li>
							<li>Amount of requests, for http 1.1 (most FT online products) making many requests can be slow, consider concatenating stylesheets and scripts to reduce number of required connections.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>


					<h3 id="security">Security</h3>
					<div>
						<p>This insight is provided from <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/">Qualys's SSL Labs</a> It looks at the https encryption for the web page and determines if it is adequate.</p>
						<p>Https is important because it prevents malicious 3<sup>rd</sup> parties, i.e. public access points, injecting adverts or malicious scripts amongst other things.</p>
						<p>There has also been discussion within browser vendors about marking unencrypted http insecure so it is important to ensure web pages are available available over https.</p>
						<p>This insight will also test for whether the https implementation is out of date and susceptible to known attacks. This may require updating your server.</p>
					</div>

					<h3 id="a11y">Accessibility</h3>
					<div>
						<p>This insight provides information about the legibility of your site.</p>
						<p>It compares the css text colour to the css background colour for block of text on the page.</p>
						<p>It then works out the contrast ratio (a number between 0 and 21). It is based upon <a href="http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/">this tool by Lea Verou.</a> Where 1 is no contrast (same colour) and 21 is comparing white to black</p>
						<p>A rating of below 4 is poor contrast and should be considered illegible.</p>
						<p>The tool measures that enough of the site is above a threshold of 4 and provides a small graph showing what proportion of the text on your page is legible.</p>
